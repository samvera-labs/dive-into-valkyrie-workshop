[Dive into Valkyrie workshop](https://samveraconnect2023.sched.com/event/1OmBk) for [Samvera Connect 2023](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/2174877699/Samvera+Connect+2023)

Valkyrie is a data persistence library which provides a common interface to multiple backends. There are a growing number of Samvera applications that use Valkyrie including Hyrax. This workshop will introduce core concepts and how they differ from ActiveFedora, ActiveRecord, and ActiveStorage. We’ll build a simple rails application that uses Valkyrie to write metadata to a postgres database and store files on disk.

This workshop assumes a general familiarity with Object Orientation and Ruby programming.

We will learn:
- Familiarity of Data Mapper pattern
- Familiarity with Valkyrie concepts
- Understanding how to use Valkyrie in a simple rails application for metadata and file storage
- Familiarity with available Valkyrie adapters
